NOT ALL SICK MEN ARE UTTERLY WRETCHED SOME ARE BLESSED WITH SONS SOME WITH FRIENDS SOME WITH RICHES SOME WITH WORTHY WORKS
THE HALT CAN MANAGE A HORSE THE HANDLESS A FLOCK THE DEAF BE A DOUGHTY FIGHTER TO BE BLIND IS BETTER THAN TO BURN ON A PYRE THERE IS NOTHING THE DEAD CAN DO
IT IS ALWAYS BETTER TO BE ALIVE THE LIVING CAN KEEP A COW FIRE I SAW WARMING A WEALTHY MAN WITH A COLD CORPSE AT HIS DOOR
A SON IS A BLESSING THOUGH BORN LATE TO A FATHER NO LONGER ALIVE STONES WOULD SELDOM STAND BY THE HIGHWAY IF SONS DID NOT SET THEM THERE
HE WELCOMES THE NIGHT WHO HAS ENOUGH PROVISIONS SHORT ARE THE SAILS OF A SHIP DANGEROUS THE DARK IN AUTUMN THE WIND MAY VEER WITHIN FIVE DAYS AND MANY TIMES IN A MONTH
THE HALF WIT DOES NOT KNOW THAT GOLD MAKES APES OF MANY MEN ONE IS RICH ONE IS POOR THERE IS NO BLAME IN THAT
CATTLE DIE KINDRED DIE EVERY MAN IS MORTAL BUT THE GOOD NAME NEVER DIES OF ONE WHO HAS DONE WELL
CATTLE DIE KINDRED DIE EVERY MAN IS MORTAL BUT I KNOW ONE THING THAT NEVER DIES THE GLORY OF THE GREAT DEAD
FIELDS AND FLOCKS HAD FITJUNGS SONS WHO NOW CARRY BEGGING BOWLS WEALTH MAY VANISH IN THE WINK OF AN EYE GOLD IS THE FALSEST OF FRIENDS
IN THE FOOL WHO ACQUIRES CATTLE AND LANDS OR WINS A WOMANS LOVE HIS WISDOM WANES WITH HIS WAXING PRIDE HE SINKS FROM SENSE TO CONCEIT
NOW IS ANSWERED WHAT YOU ASK OF THE RUNES GRAVEN BY THE GODS MADE BY THE ALL FATHER SENT BY THE POWERFUL SAGE LT IS BEST FOR MAN TO REMAIN SILENT
FOR THESE THINGS GIVE THANKS AT NIGHTFALL THE DAY GONE A GUTTERED TORCH A SWORD TESTED THE TROTH OF A MAID ICE CROSSED ALE DRUNK
HEW WOOD IN WINDTIME IN FINE WEATHER SAIL TELL IN THE NIGHTTIME TALES TO HOUSEGIRLS FOR TOO MANY EYES ARE OPEN BY DAY FROM A SHIP EXPECT SPEED FROM A SHIELD COVER KEENNESS FROM A SWORD BUT A KISS FROM A GIRL
DRINK ALE BY THE HEARTH OVER ICE GLIDE BUY A STAINED SWORD BUY A STARVING MARE TO FATTEN AT HOME AND FATTEN THE WATCHDOG
TRUST NOT AN ACRE EARLY SOWN NOR PRAISE A SON TOO SOON WEATHER RULES THE ACRE WIT THE SON BOTH ARE EXPOSED TO PERIL
A SNAPPING BOW A BURNING FLAME A GRINNING WOLF A GRUNTING BOAR A RAUCOUS CROW A ROOTLESS TREE A BREAKING WAVE A BOILING KETTLE A FLYING ARROW AN EBBING TIDE A COILED ADDER THE ICE OF A NIGHT A BRIDES BED TALK A BROAD SWORD A BEARS PLAY A PRINCE S CHILDREN A WITCH S WELCOME THE WIT OF A SLAVE A SICK CALF A CORPSE STILL FRESH A BROTHERS KILLER ENCOUNTERED UPON THE HIGHWAY A HOUSE HALFBURNED A RACING STALLION WHO HAS WRENCHED A LEG ARE NEVER SAFE LET NO MAN TRUST THEM
NO MAN SHOULD TRUST A MAIDENS WORDS NOR WHAT A WOMAN SPEAKS SPUN ON A WHEEL WERE WOMENS HEARTS IN THEIR BREASTS WAS IMPLANTED CAPRICE
TO LOVE A WOMAN WHOSE WAYS ARE FALSE IS LIKE SLEDDING OVER SLIPPERY ICE WITH UNSHOD HORSES OUT OF CONTROL BADLY TRAINED TWOYEAROLDS OR DRIFTING RUDDERLESS ON A ROUGH SEA OR CATCHING A REINDEER WITH A CRIPPLED HAND ON A THAWING HILLSIDE THINK NOT TO DO IT
NAKED I MAY SPEAK NOW FOR I KNOW BOTH MEN ARE TREACHEROUS TOO FAIREST WE SPEAK WHEN FALSEST WE THINK MANY A MAID IS DECEIVED
GALLANTLY SHALL HE SPEAK AND GIFTS BRING WHO WISHES FOR WOMANS LOVE PRAISE THE FEATURES OF THE FAIR GIRL WHO COURTS WELL WILL CONQUER
NEVER REPROACH ANOTHER FOR HIS LOVE IT HAPPENS OFTEN ENOUGH THAT BEAUTY ENSNARES WITH DESIRE THE WISE WHILE THE FOOLISH REMAIN UNMOVED
NEVER REPROACH THE PLIGHT OF ANOTHER FOR IT HAPPENS TO MANY MEN STRONG DESIRE MAY STUPEFY HEROES DULL THE WITS OF THE WISE
THE MIND ALONE KNOWS WHAT IS NEAR THE HEART EACH IS HIS OWN JUDGE THE WORST SICKNESS FOR A WISE MAN IS TO CRAVE WHAT HE CANNOT ENJOY
SO I LEARNED WHEN I SAT IN THE REEDS HOPING TO HAVE MY DESIRE LOVELY WAS THE FLESH OF THAT FAIR GIRL BUT NOTHING I HOPED FOR HAPPENED
I SAW ON A BED BILLINGS DAUGHTER SUN WHITE ASLEEP NO GREATER DELIGHT I LONGED FOR THEN THAN TO LIE IN HER LOVELY ARMS
COME ODHINN AFTER NIGHTFALL IF YOU WISH FOR A MEETING WITH ME ALL WOULD BE LOST IF ANYONE SAW US AND LEARNED THAT WE WERE LOVERS
AFIRE WITH LONGING I LEFT HER THEN DECEIVED BY HER SOFT WORDS I THOUGHT MY WOOING HAD WON THE MAID THAT I WOULD HAVE MY WAY
AFTER NIGHTFALL I HURRIED BACK BUT THE WARRIORS WERE ALL AWAKE LIGHTS WERE BURNING BLAZING TORCHES SO FALSE PROVED THE PATH
TOWARDS DAYBREAK BACK I CAME THE GUARDS WERE SOUND ASLEEP I FOUND THEN THAT THE FAIR WOMAN HAD TIED A BITCH TO HER BED
MANY A GIRL WHEN ONE GETS TO KNOW HER PROVES TO BE FICKLE AND FALSE THAT TREACHEROUS MAIDEN TAUGHT ME A LESSON THE CRAFTY WOMAN COVERED ME WITH SHAME THAT WAS ALL I GOT FROM HER
LET A MAN WITH HIS GUESTS BE GLAD AND MERRY MODEST A MAN SHOULD BE BUT TALK WELL IF HE INTENDS TO BE WISE AND EXPECTS PRAISE FROM MEN FIMBUL FAMBI IS THE FOOL CALLED UNABLE TO OPEN HIS MOUTH FRUITLESS MY ERRAND HAD I BEEN SILENT WHEN I CAME TO SUTTUNGS COURTS WITH SPIRITED WORDS I SPOKE TO MY PROFIT IN THE HALL OF THE AGED GIANT
RATI HAD GNAWED A NARROW PASSAGE CHEWED A CHANNEL THROUGH STONE A PATH AROUND THE ROADS OF GIANTS I WAS LIKE TO LOSE MY HEAD
GUNNLOD SAT ME IN THE GOLDEN SEAT POURED ME PRECIOUS MEAD ILL REWARD SHE HAD FROM ME FOR THAT FOR HER PROUD AND PASSIONATE HEART HER BROODING FOREBODING SPIRIT
WHAT I WON FROM HER I HAVE WELL USED I HAVE WAXED IN WISDOM SINCE I CAME BACK BRINGING TO ASGARD ODRERIR THE SACRED DRAUGHT
HARDLY WOULD I HAVE COME HOME ALIVE FROM THE GARTH OF THE GRIM TROLL HAD GUNNLOD NOT HELPED ME THE GOOD WOMAN WHO WRAPPED HER ARMS AROUND ME
THE FOLLOWING DAY THE FROST GIANTS CAME WALKED INTO HARS HALL TO ASK FOR HARS ADVICE HAD BOLVERK THEY ASKED COME BACK TO HIS FRIENDS OR HAD HE BEEN SLAIN BY SUTTUNG
ODHINN THEY SAID SWORE AN OATH ON HIS RING WHO FROM NOW ON WILL TRUST HIM BY FRAUD AT THE FEAST HE BEFUDDLED SUTTUNG AND BROUGHT GRIEF TO GUNNLOD
IT IS TIME TO SING IN THE SEAT OF THE WISE OF WHAT AT URDS WELL I SAW IN SILENCE SAW AND THOUGHT ON LONG I LISTENED TO MEN RUNES HEARD SPOKEN COUNSELS REVEALED AT HARS HALL IN HARS HALL THERE I HEARD THIS
LODDFAFNIR LISTEN TO MY COUNSEL YOU WILL FARE WELL IF YOU FOLLOW IT IT WILL HELP YOU MUCH IF YOU HEED IT
NEVER RISE AT NIGHT UNLESS YOU NEED TO SPY OR TO EASE YOURSELF IN THE OUTHOUSE
SHUN A WOMAN WISE IN MAGIC HER BED AND HER EMBRACES IF SHE CAST A SPELL YOU WILL CARE NO LONGER TO MEET AND SPEAK WITH MEN DESIRE NO FOOD DESIRE NO PLEASURE IN SORROW FALL ASLEEP
NEVER SEDUCE ANOTHERS WIFE NEVER MAKE HER YOUR MISTRESS
IF YOU MUST JOURNEY TO MOUNTAINS AND FIRTHS TAKE FOOD AND FODDER WITH YOU
NEVER OPEN YOUR HEART TO AN EVIL MAN WHEN FORTUNE DOES NOT FAVOUR YOU FROM AN EVIL MAN IF YOU MAKE HIM YOUR FRIEND YOU WILL GET EVIL FOR GOOD
I SAW A WARRIOR WOUNDED FATALLY BY THE WORDS OF AN EVIL WOMAN HER CUNNING TONGUE CAUSED HIS DEATH THOUGH WHAT SHE ALLEGED WAS A LIE
IF YOU KNOW A FRIEND YOU CAN FULLY TRUST GO OFTEN TO HIS HOUSE GRASS AND BRAMBLES GROW QUICKLY UPON THE UNTRODDEN TRACK
WITH A GOOD MAN IT IS GOOD TO TALK MAKE HIM YOUR FAST FRIEND BUT WASTE NO WORDS ON A WITLESS OAF NOR SIT WITH A SENSELESS APE
CHERISH THOSE NEAR YOU NEVER BE THE FIRST TO BREAK WITH A FRIEND CARE EATS HIM WHO CAN NO LONGER OPEN HIS HEART TO ANOTHER
AN EVIL MAN IF YOU MAKE HIM YOUR FRIEND WILL GIVE YOU EVIL FOR GOOD A GOOD MAN IF YOU MAKE HIM YOUR FRIEND WILL PRAISE YOU IN EVERY PLACE
AFFECTION IS MUTUAL WHEN MEN CAN OPEN ALL THEIR HEART TO EACH OTHER HE WHOSE WORDS ARE ALWAYS FAIR IS UNTRUE AND NOT TO BE TRUSTED
BANDY NO SPEECH WITH A BAD MAN OFTEN THE BETTER IS BEATEN IN A WORD FIGHT BY THE WORSE
BE NOT A COBBLER NOR A CARVER OF SHAFTS EXCEPT IT BE FOR YOURSELF IF A SHOE FIT ILL OR A SHAFT BE CROOKED THE MAKER GETS CURSES AND KICKS
IF AWARE THAT ANOTHER IS WICKED SAY SO MAKE NO TRUCE OR TREATY WITH FOES
NEVER SHARE IN THE SHAMEFULLY GOTTEN BUT ALLOW YOURSELF WHAT IS LAWFUL
NEVER LIFT YOUR EYES AND LOOK UP IN BATTLE LEST THE HEROES ENCHANT YOU WHO CAN CHANGE WARRIORS SUDDENLY INTO HOGS WITH A GOOD WOMAN IF YOU WISH TO ENJOY HER WORDS AND HER GOOD WILL PLEDGE HER FAIRLY AND BE FAITHFUL TO IT ENJOY THE GOOD YOU ARE GIVEN
BE NOT OVER WARY BUT WARY ENOUGH FIRST OF THE FOAMING ALE SECOND OF A WOMAN WED TO ANOTHER THIRD OF THE TRICKS OF THIEVES
MOCK NOT THE TRAVELLER MET ON THE ROAD NOR MALICIOUSLY LAUGH AT THE GUEST SCOFF NOT AT GUESTS NOR TO THE GATE CHASE THEM BUT RELIEVE THE LONELY AND WRETCHED
THE SITTERS IN THE HALL SELDOM KNOW THE KIN OF THE NEWCOMER THE BEST MAN IS MARRED BY FAULTS THE WORST IS NOT WITHOUT WORTH
NEVER LAUGH AT THE OLD WHEN THEY OFFER COUNSEL OFTEN THEIR WORDS ARE WISE FROM SHRIVELLED SKIN FROM SCRAGGY THINGS THAT HAND AMONG THE HIDES AND MOVE AMID THE GUTS CLEAR WORDS OFTEN COME
HEAVY THE BEAM ABOVE THE DOOR HANG A HORSESHOE ON IT AGAINST ILLLUCK LEST IT SHOULD SUDDENLY CRASH AND CRUSH YOUR GUESTS
MEDICINES EXIST AGAINST MANY EVILS EARTH AGAINST DRUNKENNESS HEATHER AGAINST WORMS OAK AGAINST COSTIVENESS CORN AGAINST SORCERY SPURRED RYE AGAINST RUPTURE RUNES AGAINST BALES THE MOON AGAINST FEUDS FIRE AGAINST SICKNESS EARTH MAKES HARMLESS THE FLOODS
WOUNDED I HUNG ON A WINDSWEPT GALLOWS FOR NINE LONG NIGHTS PIERCED BY A SPEAR PLEDGED TO ODHINN OFFERED MYSELF TO MYSELF THE WISEST KNOW NOT FROM WHENCE SPRING THE ROOTS OF THAT ANCIENT ROOD
THEY GAVE ME NO BREAD THEY GAVE ME NO MEAD I LOOKED DOWN WITH A LOUD CRY I TOOK UP RUNES FROM THAT TREE I FELL
NINE LAYS OF POWER I LEARNED FROM THE FAMOUS BOLTHOR BESTLA S FATHER HE POURED ME A DRAUGHT OF PRECIOUS MEAD MIXED WITH MAGIC ODRERIR
WAXED AND THROVE WELL WORD FROM WORD GAVE WORDS TO ME DEED FROM DEED GAVE DEEDS TO ME
RUNES YOU WILL FIND AND READABLE STAVES VERY STRONG STAVES VERY STOUT STAVES STAVES THAT BOLTHOR STAINED MADE BY MIGHTY POWERS GRAVEN BY THE PROPHETIC GOD
FOR THE GODS BY ODHINN FOR THE ELVES BY DAIN BY DVALIN TOO FOR THE DWARVES BY ASVID FOR THE HATEFUL GIANTS AND SOME I CARVED MYSELF THUND BEFORE MAN WAS MADE SCRATCHED THEM WHO ROSE FIRST FELL THEREAFTER
KNOW HOW TO CUT THEM KNOW HOW TO READ THEM KNOW HOW TO STAIN THEM KNOW HOW TO PROVE THEM KNOW HOW TO EVOKE THEM KNOW HOW TO SCORE THEM KNOW HOW TO SEND THEM KNOW HOW TO SEND THEM
BETTER NOT TO ASK THAN TO OVERPLEDGE AS A GIFT THAT DEMANDS A GIFT BETTER NOT TO SEND THAN TO SLAY TOO MANY
THE FIRST CHARM I KNOW IS UNKNOWN TO RULERS OR ANY OF HUMAN KIND HELP IT IS NAMED FOR HELP IT CAN GIVE IN HOURS OF SORROW AND ANGUISH
I KNOW A SECOND THAT THE SONS OF MEN MUST LEARN WHO WISH TO BE LEECHES
I KNOW A THIRD IN THE THICK OF BATTLE IF MY NEED BE GREAT ENOUGH IT WILL BLUNT THE EDGES OF ENEMY SWORDS THEIR WEAPONS WILL MAKE NO WOUNDS
I KNOW A FOURTH IT WILL FREE ME QUICKLY IF FOES SHOULD BIND ME FAST WITH STRONG CHAINS A CHANT THAT MAKES FETTERS SPRING FROM THE FEET BONDS BURST FROM THE H
